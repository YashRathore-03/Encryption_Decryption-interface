This C++ code is an application for user registration, login, and message encryption/decryption using Caesar, Vigenère, and RSA encryption methods. It leverages the OpenSSL library for RSA operations. Here is a summary of its main components and functionality:

### Key Functionalities:
1. **Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption:**
   - `caesar_cipher_encrypt`: Shifts each alphabetic character in the input text by a specified number of positions.
   - `caesar_cipher_decrypt`: Shifts each alphabetic character in the input text backward by the specified number of positions.

2. **Vigenère Cipher Encryption and Decryption:**
   - `vigenere_cipher_encrypt`: Uses a repeating key to shift each alphabetic character in the input text.
   - `vigenere_cipher_decrypt`: Uses the same key to reverse the Vigenère encryption.

3. **RSA Key Pair Generation, Encryption, and Decryption:**
   - `rsa_generate_key_pair`: Generates a pair of RSA keys (public and private) using OpenSSL.
   - `rsa_encrypt`: Encrypts a message using the RSA public key.
   - `rsa_decrypt`: Decrypts a message using the RSA private key (although decryption is not fully integrated in the main program loop).

### Main Application Logic:
1. **User Registration and Login:**
   - Users can register by providing a username. A placeholder password ("password") is used for demonstration.
   - Users can log in by providing their username and password.

2. **Encryption/Decryption Workflow:**
   - After a successful login, users can choose to encrypt or decrypt messages.
   - For encryption, users can select from Caesar Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, or RSA.
   - For decryption, users can select from Caesar Cipher or Vigenère Cipher. RSA decryption is not fully implemented in the interactive part.

### Program Flow:
1. **Main Menu:**
   - Users can choose to register, log in, or quit the application.

2. **User Registration:**
   - Prompts for a username and assigns a default password.

3. **User Login:**
   - Prompts for username and password, then verifies credentials.

4. **Post-Login Menu:**
   - Users can choose to encrypt or decrypt a message, or log out.

5. **Encryption/Decryption:**
   - Depending on user choice, the program will prompt for necessary information (shift value for Caesar, key for Vigenère, or generate RSA keys) and perform the respective encryption or decryption.

### Summary:
This program is a simple demonstration of user management combined with basic encryption techniques. It introduces users to cryptographic concepts and allows them to interactively encrypt and decrypt messages. RSA functionality is demonstrated, but full integration (especially RSA decryption) could be expanded for a complete feature set.
